REX API ðŸ¦– a S.O.C. ðŸ§¦ product
=============

The REX API is a medium for users of REX to store account, workout, friends and equipment information through the use of a JSON RESTful web interface. Currently authentication is required to access most resources and uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) in order to handle authentication.


Making a Request
-------------

All requests start with https://rex.fitness/api/v1/resource

A curl request might look something like:

```shell
curl
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your.acquired.token.here' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Chrome' \
  https://rex.fitness/api/v1/workout
```

Authentication
-------------
You'll need to acquire a JWT Token from the login endpoint and then include them in the Authorization header.

```shell
curl
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Chrome' \
  -d '{ "loginName": "chaoz133", "password": "McYeet420" }' \
  https://rex.fitness/api/v1/login
```

Throttling (TODO)
-------------

You can perform up to 5 request/second from the same IP address. If you exceed this limit, you'll get a 429 Too Many Requests response for subsequent requests. API usage is limited. Hippity Hoppity get off my property.

Errors
-------------
The actions you can access in the API are dependant upon the permission levels assigned to your Image Relay account.
For instance, not all users are permitted to upload files or create folders, or see a list of users. If you find yourself
receiving "401 Unauthorized" errors, please confirm your permission level with your Image Relay Administrator.

If you find a typo or an error in the documentation, we welcome pull requests. You can also [submit an issue](https://github.com/imagerelay/API/issues) (will require a github account) and we will look into it.
