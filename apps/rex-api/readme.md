REX API ü¶ñ a S.O.C. üß¶ product
=============

The REX API is a medium for users of REX to store account, workout, friends and equipment information through the use of a JSON RESTful web interface. Currently authentication is required to access most resources and uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) in order to handle authentication.


Making a Request
-------------

All requests start with https://rex.fitness/api/v1/resource

A curl request might look something like:

```shell
curl
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your.acquired.token.here' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Chrome' \
  https://rex.fitness/api/v1/workout
```

Authentication
-------------
You'll need to acquire a JWT Token from the login endpoint and then include them in the Authorization header.

```shell
curl
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Chrome' \
  -d '{ "loginName": "chaoz133", "password": "McYeet420" }' \
  https://rex.fitness/api/v1/login
```

Throttling (TODO)
-------------

You can perform up to 5 request/second from the same IP address. If you exceed this limit, you'll get a 429 Too Many Requests response for subsequent requests. API usage is limited. Hippity Hoppity get off my property.
