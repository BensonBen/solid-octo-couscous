# Notes on deploying all things Solid Octo Couscous ðŸ¦– ðŸ§¦

## Set Environment variables in a file `.env`

-   _note_ these variables will need to be discoverable by the node process once it's loaded up by `PM2`.

## Build REX API using NX tooling

-   ```bash
    ng build rex-api --prod
    ```
-   Alternatively use NX plugin for vs code and build REX API that way.

---

## Running REX API as a standalone application

-   ensure `.env` file remains in the same directory as the generated script from NX tooling.
-   ensure `nvm` is globally installed via your flavor of package manager.
-   ensure `pm2` is globally installed via your flavor of package manager.
-   ensure you're using at least node `12.x` and preferrably `14.x`.
-   ensure `ecosystem.config.js` is present and configured correctly to use `dot-env` node package for environment variable loading.
-   ensure redis database is discoverable on the machine you're about to deploy on through docker, or by means of a VPN.
-   use
    ```bash
    sudo pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
    ```
    to get started running rex-api on your server.
-   ensure the application is running by inspecting the logs for pm2.
    ```bash
    pm2 log --lines 5000 | less
    ```
-   ensure the application is running by inspecting the monitoring functionaly provided by pm2.
    ```bash
    pm2 monit
    ```
