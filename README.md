## Motivation
There are a bunch of biking exercise bike applications that are overall unfriendly to use. Overly complicated, not user driver
and other things that could be improved upon in the industry.

## Build status
**TODO** setup build status in future update.
<!-- Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. - 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akashnimare/foco)

## Contribution Guidelines (Provided by Nx)

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
   1. run `ng test my-app` to execute unit tests using [jest](https://jestjs.io)
   2. run `nx affected:test` to execute end-to-end tests affected by the change.
3. Update API information as needed.

## Tests
Install `nodejs, npm, and globally install the npm package nx` from the base of the application run `nx test`. You may have to restart your command line if you just installed `nx` globally using `npm`

## How to use?
You'll be able to use the application locally through running it in development mode, or you can have an example of the application availible here `TODO`
